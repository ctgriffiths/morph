# Test 'morph build' when build without push is disabled, i.e. everything is
# built from the remote repositories instead of the local checkouts.

# FIXME: This seems to break because the new "morph edit" makes correct
# changes to build-dependencies, which breaks the old "morph build".
# Disable test now, re-enable it after "morph build" is fixed. --liw
