.SH OPTIONS
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.B morph
cleans out the environment when it runs builds,
so that builds are not affected by random enviroment variables set by the user.

itself, or the builds it runs.

keeps the user's 
.B PATH
if the
.B \-\-keep\-path
option is used.
Additionally,
.B morph
will prepend the location of the 
.BR ccache (1)
binaries to the path,
unless the
.B no-cache
setting is enabled.
.TP
.BR DISTCC_HOSTS ", " TMPDIR ", " LD_PRELOAD ", " LD_LIBRARY_PATH ", " FAKEROOTKEY ", " FAKED_MODE ", " FAKEROOT_FD_BASE
