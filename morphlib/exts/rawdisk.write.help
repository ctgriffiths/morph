    Create a raw disk image during Morph's deployment.
    
    If the image already exists, it is upgraded.

    The `location` argument is a pathname to the image to be
    created or upgraded.

    The INITRAMFS_PATH option can be used to specify the location of an
    initramfs for syslinux to tell Linux to use, rather than booting
    the rootfs directly.
