NEWS for Morph
==============

This file contains high-level summaries of user-visible changes in
each Morph release.

Version 14.24, released 2014-06-13
----------------------------------

* rawdisk deployments check that they have the btrfs module loaded first
* distbuild should busy-wait less
* fetching of artifacts should be atomic, so a failure to fetch the
  metadata of an artifact doesn't confuse the build system when we have
  the chunk, but no metadata
* `morph deploy` now defaults to `--no-git-update`
* `morph gc` now cleans up failed deployments, so they aren't left around
  if morph terminates uncleanly
* `morph edit` now only takes the name of the chunk, rather than the
  name of the system and stratum that chunk is in

Version 14.23, released 2014-06-06
----------------------------------

New feature:

* Initramfs support

There have also been a number of fixes to distbuild, and the
`morph copy-artifacts` command has been replaced by `morph list-artifacts`.

Version 14.22, released 2014-05-29
----------------------------------

New features:

* VirtualBox deployment now supports Vagrant. See:
  <http://wiki.baserock.org/guides/vagrant-basebox/>

* Additional checks when deploying upgrades with the 'ssh-rsync' extension.

Additional bug fixes described in the git log.

Version 14.20, released 2014-05-14
----------------------------------

New features include:

* New CPU architecture: armv7lhf (ARM hard float).

* Artifact splitting for chunk and stratum artifacts.

* Components that can be used to set up a distributed build network of Morph
  build workers.

* Built-in documentation for some extensions, see `morph help-extensions` and
  `morph help <extension>`.

* Nested deployment by `morph deploy`.

* Support for adding binaries to Git repos when used with Trove. See the `morph
  add-binary` and `morph push` commands.

Many additional changes are described in the Git log.

Version 13, released 2014-01-10
-------------------------------

New features added:

* New CPU architecture: ppc64 architecture (POWER PC 64-bit). This is
  the change specific for Morph. There are changes to the morphologies
  (in a different git repository) to actually build such systems.

* `morph build` and `morph deploy` now allow `.morph` suffixes in
  command line arguments. The suffixes are stripped internally, so
  Morph behaves as if they suffix wasn't there in the first place.

* The `morph build` command is now a new implementation. The old
  implementation is still available as `morph old-build`, just in case
  the new code is buggy, but will be removed in a future release.
  Likewise, `morph deploy` has a new implementation, but no
  `old-deploy`. Both new implementations should work exactly as the
  old ones, except for bugs.

Bugs fixed:

* When Morph reads git configuration files, it now correctly handles
  whitespace at the end of configuration values.

* `morph deploy` no longer creates and pushes a temporary build
  branch. Pushing it wasn't useful, merely wasteful.

* `morph deploy` now allows cross-architecture deployments, and
  and `morph cross-bootstrap` checks that the system is being built
  supports the target architecture.

Other user-visible changes:

* When preparing to build (when construcing the build graph), Morph
  now reports the ref (SHA1) it uses for each stratum.

* Systems being built must now have at least one stratum, and the
  strata in a system must have at least one chunk that is built using
  the normal (staging area) mode, rather than bootstrap mode.

Version 12, released 2013-11-15
-------------------------------

* NEWS file added.
